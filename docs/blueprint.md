- Accent color: Indigo (#6366F1) to highlight interactive elements and CTAs. An optional pink accent (#EC4899) can be used sparingly.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for titles, to convey a modern, technical aesthetic.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability and a clean interface.
- Use modern, minimalist icons, primarily SVG format, to enhance visual appeal and performance.
- Employ a responsive, mobile-first layout with full-width sections and consistent padding to ensure visual consistency across devices.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in animations on scroll, hover effects on cards and buttons, animated counters, and a light parallax effect in the hero section to add a dynamic touch.
